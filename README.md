# Encryption/Decryption Tool

This is a group project to build a simple command-line tool that can **encrypt** or **decrypt** messages from text files using **Caesar cipher** or **Morse code**.

---

## Description

The program reads a message from an input file, encrypts or decrypts it using the selected method, and writes the result to an output file.

You can choose between:
- **Caesar cipher** (with a custom right shift)
- **Morse code**

---

## How to Use

Run the tool from the terminal:

```bash
python main.py -h
```
This will show a help message with usage instructions.
